## 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts **crop yield** based on environmental and soil parameters using a **Linear Regression** model.
It also provides **visual analytics**, **performance evaluation**, and **crop recommendations** for new input data.

### ⚙️ Model Evaluation

* Calculates and displays key performance metrics:

  * **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** – Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted yields.
  * **R² Score** – Indicates how well the model fits the data.
* Provides a quick understanding of **model accuracy and reliability**.

### 🌱 Predict Yield for New Crop Field

* Interactive interface with sliders and input boxes for:
  **Rainfall, Temperature, Humidity, Soil pH, and Nutrient Levels.**
* Instantly predicts the **expected crop yield (kg/ha)** for the given inputs.
* Suggests **suitable crops** (e.g., Paddy 🌾, Sugarcane 🍬, Cotton 🧵) based on the predicted yield range.
